<h1>GNAP Tests</h1>
Please run the bash scripts after cloning the repository. You may have to change the bash binary path in the scripts.<br>
<br><ul>
  <li>Run testjava.sh to test the java code</li>
  <li>Run testcpp.sh to test the C++ code</li>
</ul>
<br>
Please note that since the code is randomized, it will not find the optimum every time it is run (unless it is run for a very large number of iterations).
